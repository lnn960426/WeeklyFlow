## üß≠ Design Philosophy

> ‚ÄúPlanning should feel grounding, not overwhelming.‚Äù

WeekFlow is built around a **calm visual rhythm** ‚Äî you see your entire week at a glance,  
but interact only with what matters today.  
Every click feels intentional: a soft transition, a focused action, a clear completion.  

The project balances **aesthetic design** with **functional clarity**,  
merging my inner designer and developer mindsets.
